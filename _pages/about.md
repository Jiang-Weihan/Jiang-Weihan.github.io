Hi, I am a graduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), China.

I was born in Jilin, China. I recieved my Bachelor degree(2021) in Automation at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) in Weihai, China.

Currently,  I am doing research on rehabilitation robots and human motion identification, under the guidance of  Prof. [Han Zhang](https://zhanghan-tc.github.io/).
Our research on inverse optimal control focuses on modelling human tracking behaviour with consistency.

 **Keywords**: rehabilitation robot,  inverse optimal control and system identification.

  - As one of the most fundamental rehabilitation tasks, the **tracking** motions between the patients are highly personalized. Maximizing the treatment potency requires us to understand and model the patient's personalized tracking pattern.  
  In this paper, we model the behaviour of a patient tracking a given reference signal by a linear quadratic optimal problem, while her control inputs are corrupted by **signal-dependent noise**. Since the parameters in the objective function stand for the trade-off between tracking error and control effort, 
they are interpreted as the ``personalized" tracking motion pattern and the goal is to identify them based on the observed data. 
  Such a problem is called Inverse Optimal Control (IOC). 
  We first prove that the model structure is **identifiable**. Then we propose a **statistically consistent IOC algorithm** that handles multiplicative noise induced by muscle fluctuations. The consistent performance is then illustrated by both numerical **simulations** and **experiments**.
