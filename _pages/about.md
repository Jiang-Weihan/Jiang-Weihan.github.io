Hi, I am a graduate student in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), China.

I was born in Jilin, China. I recieved the Bachelor degree(2021) in Automation at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) in Weihai, China.

Currently I am doing research on rehabilitation robot based on inverse optimal control, under the guidance of  Prof. [Han Zhang](https://zhanghan-tc.github.io/).


 **Keywords**: rehabilitation robot ,  inverse optimal control and system identification.
