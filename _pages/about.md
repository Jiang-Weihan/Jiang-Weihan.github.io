Hi, I am a graduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), China.

I was born in Jilin, China. I recieved my Bachelor degree(2021) in Automation at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) in Weihai, China.

Currently,  I am doing research on rehabilitation robots and human motion identification, under the guidance of  Prof. [Han Zhang](https://zhanghan-tc.github.io/).
Our research on inverse optimal control focuses on modelling human tracking behaviour with consistency.

 **Keywords**: rehabilitation robot,  inverse optimal control and system identification.

**E-mail**: JiangWH9@sjtu.edu.cn

Education
------
- 2021 - - March 2024(expected): M.S. in Department of Automation, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)
- 2017-2021: B.S. in Department of Automation, [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/)

Publication
------
- Identifying the tracking motion pattern in rehabilitation using inverse optimal control - **accepted** by China Automation Congress, IEEE
  - Maximizing the treatment potency requires us to understand and model the patient's **personalized** tracking pattern.  
  - The behaviour of a patient tracking a given reference signal is modelled by a linear quadratic optimal problem, while her control inputs are corrupted by **signal-dependent noise**. 
  - The **identifiability** for the model structure and the **consistency** for the identification algorithm is proved .
  - The performance of the algorithm is illustrated by both numerical simulations and experiments.
